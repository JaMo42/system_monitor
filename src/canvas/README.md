# Canvas

Draw in the terminal using Unicode Braille characters.
A very stripped down C port of [asciimoo's](https://github.com/asciimoo) [drawille](https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille).

Only the functionality relevant for this program has been ported.
There are little to no error/safety checks and the canvas can only render to
a curses window.
